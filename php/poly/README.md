# Poly

Found it here: http://ponderingobjectorienteddesign.blogspot.hu/2010/02/code-katas-id-like-to-see-more-of.html

The goal is to refactor a poorly thought-through little program to replace conditional with polymorphism.
And also to clean the tests too to get rid of duplications.

I've made a few tweaks to the original one - besides porting it to php.
