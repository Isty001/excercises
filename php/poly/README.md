# Poly

Found it here: http://ponderingobjectorienteddesign.blogspot.hu/2010/02/code-katas-id-like-to-see-more-of.html

The goal is to refactor a poorly thought-through little program to replace conditional with polymorphism.
And also to clean the tests too to get rid of duplications.

I've made a few tweaks to the original one - besides porting it to php. 

> Refactor using \"replace conditional with polymorphism\". Do this kata five days in a row, refactoring to a different design pattern each time. Then do it one more time only this time focus on taking the smallest steps possible and still keep the tests green. Also find ways to clean up the test code, as there's some duplication that can go as well.
